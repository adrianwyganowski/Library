Mobile first e-commerce alike multi page app without backend and database. Books data are fetched from google books api. Every needed data is stored in SessionStorage. For this project I used vanilla JS and SASS. For me the most important thing in this project was to learn how to use async JS and Revealing Module Pattern. In this app I implemented: 
- searching books by name, authors, isbn etc,
- creating users (don't use your normal password becouse I did not use salting and hasing),
- validation of users (E.g. if passwords matches, if email is already in sessionStorage, number of charactes in password), 
- log in to your account to be able to add books to the cart,
- working cart.
 
 To be able to work on this app I use Visuals Studio Code Live Server.
